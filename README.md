# TetrisUnity

As the name says, Tetris designed in Unity.

This was my "Intro to Unity" project I built while working at a summer internship with the development team at Stocket. Shoutouts to them for all the guidance with making this game actually work, as well as with the many intricacies of using Unity.

# Features
- You can play Tetris
- Different colored blocks each playthrough
- That's really about it

# Controls
- Left, right, and down arrow keys to move the piece
- Spacebar to slam the block down
- 'Z' and 'X' buttons are rotate left and right

If you dislike/hate/want to change the controls, look at the Update() function inside of GridManager.cs.

I will release my code with the MIT License, which lets you basicially do anything you want with it. This DOES NOT include anything having to do with Unity; only the scripts in the 'Assets -> Scripts' folder fall under this license. And don't be afraid to shoot me a message if you do use my code in any of your own projects :)
