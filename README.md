# TetrisUnity

As the name says, Tetris designed in Unity.

This was my "Intro to Unity" project I built while working at a summer internship with the guys at Stocket. Shoutouts to them for all the guidance with making this game actually work, as well as with the many intricacies of using Unity. You should check their game out (which I may be working with them on...) at www.stocket.com.

# Features
- You can play Tetris
- Different colored blocks each playthrough
- That's really about it

I will release my code with the MIT License, which lets you basicially do anything you want with it. This DOES NOT include anything having to do with Unity; only the scripts in the 'Assets -> Scripts' folder fall under this license. And don't be afraid to shoot me a message if you do use my code in any of your own projects :)
